## 🏃 If You Just Want to Use It (Not Record Video)

### Step 1: Prerequisites (5 minutes)

**Check if you have Claude Code:**
```bash
claude --version
```

**If not installed:**
- macOS/Linux: See [Claude Code docs](https://docs.claude.com/)
- Or watch Episode 01 of this series
- Or comment on the YouTube video for help

---

### Step 2: Clone Repository (2 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/anton-abyzov/ai-power.git

# Navigate to this episode
cd ai-power/episodes/02-resume-fine-tuner

# Verify files
ls -la
```

---

### Step 3: Set Up the Agent (5 minutes)

**Option A: Copy the agent file**
```bash
# Create agents directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents

# Copy agent
cp prompts/resume-fine-tuner-agent.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

**Option B: Create manually**
1. Open `prompts/resume-fine-tuner-agent.md`
2. Copy the entire content
3. Create a new file in your project: `resume-fine-tuner-agent.md`
4. Paste and save

**Test it works:**
```bash
claude
# Inside Claude:
@resume-fine-tuner help
```

Should show agent description and capabilities.

---

### Step 4: Create Your Experience Database (1-2 hours, one-time!)

**This is the most important step. Take your time.**

**Choose your template:**
- Software/Tech: `templates/experience-software-engineer.md`
- Marketing/Growth: `templates/experience-marketing-manager.md`
- Sales/Real Estate: `templates/experience-real-estate-agent.md`

**Copy and customize:**
```bash
# Example for software engineer
cp templates/experience-software-engineer.md experience-db/my-experience.md

# Open and edit with YOUR info
code experience-db/my-experience.md
# or
vim experience-db/my-experience.md
# or
nano experience-db/my-experience.md
```

**What to include:**
✅ Every role (current → past)
✅ Technologies, tools, frameworks
✅ Quantified achievements (with realistic metrics: 20-40%, not "10x")
✅ Team size, scale, impact
✅ Education, certifications
✅ Skills (categorized: expert → intermediate)

**Pro tips:**
- Be honest (you'll discuss this in interviews)
- Use realistic numbers (25% improvement > "revolutionary")
- Include context (team size, scale, budget)
- Organize chronologically (newest first)

---

### Step 5: Find a Job & Generate Resume (2 minutes)

**Find a real job:**
1. Go to LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, or company career page
2. Find a role that matches your experience
3. Copy the full job description
4. Save it: `job-descriptions/[company-name]-[role].md`

**Generate resume:**
```bash
# Start Claude
claude

# Inside Claude, use this prompt:
@resume-fine-tuner

Create a tailored resume for [JOB TITLE] at [COMPANY NAME]:

Read job description: job-descriptions/[company-name]-[role].md

Use experience database: experience-db/my-experience.md

Output file: outputs/[company-name]-[role]-2025-10-01.md

Emphasize:
- [Key skill 1 from job posting]
- [Key skill 2 from job posting]
- [Key skill 3 from job posting]
- [Key achievement type they want]

Ensure 90%+ keyword match while maintaining authenticity.
```

**Wait 60-90 seconds** while Claude:
- Reads job description
- Extracts keywords
- Searches your experience DB
- Matches relevant achievements
- Writes tailored resume

**Done!** Resume saved to `outputs/` folder.

---

### Step 6: Convert to Desired Format (1 minute)

**Claude outputs Markdown by default. Convert to:**

**Word (.docx) - Recommended:**
```bash
pandoc outputs/your-resume.md -o outputs/your-resume.docx
```

**PDF (from Word):**
1. Open the .docx file in Word
2. File → Save As → PDF
3. Done!

**Or use online converters (no installation):**
- Dillinger.io - Paste Markdown → Export as PDF/DOCX
- StackEdit.io - Paste Markdown → Export
- CloudConvert.com - Upload .md → Convert to PDF/DOCX

**LaTeX (for academic resumes):**
```bash
pandoc outputs/your-resume.md -o outputs/your-resume.tex
```
Then compile in Overleaf or with LaTeX installed locally.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Build Your Experience DB Thoroughly (Once)
- Spend 1-2 hours making it comprehensive
- Include EVERY achievement, technology, metric
- The richer your DB, the better every resume will be
- This is a one-time investment with infinite returns

### Tip 2: Save Job Descriptions That Worked
```bash
# When you get an interview, save the JD
mkdir -p job-descriptions/interviews
cp [job-description].txt job-descriptions/interviews/
```
- Pattern recognition: What keywords led to interviews?
- Reuse for similar roles

### Tip 3: Track Your Results
Create a simple CSV:
```csv
Date,Company,Role,Response,Interview,Offer,Notes
2025-10-01,TechCorp,Senior SWE,Yes,Yes,Pending,Great culture fit
2025-10-02,StartupXYZ,Staff Eng,No,-,-,Too senior
```

Helps you optimize over time.

### Tip 4: Customize the Prompt for Each Job
Don't just paste job description. Add:
```
Emphasize:
- [Specific tech from JD]
- [Type of experience they want]
- [Company culture fit]

De-emphasize:
- [Irrelevant experience]

Tone: [Startup casual / Enterprise formal / Academic rigorous]
```

More specific = better results.

### Tip 5: Use Variations for Different Seniority
**Same job type, different levels:**
- Junior: Emphasize learning, growth, foundational skills
- Mid: Emphasize delivery, technical depth, independence
- Senior: Emphasize leadership, architecture, business impact
- Staff+: Emphasize strategy, org-level impact, technical direction

Same experience DB, different emphasis.

## 🚨 Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

### Mistake 1: Rushing the Experience DB
❌ "I'll add more later"
✅ Take 1-2 hours to make it comprehensive NOW

**Why:** Every resume pulls from this. Garbage in = garbage out.

### Mistake 2: Copying Job Description Blindly
❌ Just pasting JD without reading
✅ Analyze JD, identify key requirements, tell Claude what to emphasize

**Why:** Claude is smart, but your context helps.

### Mistake 3: Not Tracking Results
❌ "I'll remember what worked"
✅ Track every application, response, interview

**Why:** Data tells you what to optimize.

### Mistake 4: Using Unrealistic Metrics
❌ "Improved performance 10x"
✅ "Reduced latency 28% through caching"

**Why:** You'll have to defend metrics in interviews. Be honest.

### Mistake 5: One Generic Experience DB
❌ Cramming everything into one file
✅ Organize: `experience-db/software-eng.md`, `experience-db/devops.md`

**Why:** Different career paths need different emphasis.

### Recording Order (Most Efficient):

**Session 1: On-Camera (30 min)**

- Marketing manager demo (uncut)
- Real estate agent demo (uncut)
- Show generated resumes

**Session 5: Voiceover (1.5 hours)**
- Record following script
- High energy, clear pronunciation
- Record in sections

**Session 6: Editing (6-8 hours)**
- Sync voiceover
- Add text overlays
- Animate metrics
- Color grade
- Export

**Total:** 12-15 hours for a professional 15-18 min video

## 📊 Success Criteria

**You'll know it's working when:**

✅ First resume generated in under 5 minutes
✅ Resume contains 90%+ of job keywords
✅ All achievements are from YOUR real experience (authentic)
✅ Response rate improves (track first 10 applications)
✅ You're spending 2 minutes per resume, not 2 hours

**Iterate if:**
- Response rate is still low (<30%) → Add more keywords to experience DB
- Resumes feel generic → Add more specific project details
- ATS rejecting → Simplify formatting, use standard headers
- Too long (>2 pages) → Prioritize recent experience, remove older roles
